# These settings may vary...
# It is possible to use arbitrary values here,
# I just reported the ones which are supported by my hardware.
# This is the value passed directly to the IPMI raw command, so also hex values are accepted.
#
# IPMI known fan modes :
# - Standard = 0 or 0x00
# - Full     = 1 or 0x01
# - Optimal  = 2 or 0x02
# - HeavyIO  = 4 or 0x04
#
# IPMIFC custom mode:
# - Custom   = custom
# Custom mode will set native FullMode under the hood,
# it will also enable control with the below controllers.
# Editing the ipmi zones duty-cycle without setting 'custom' (ipmi Full mode behind the scenes) first will non work.
